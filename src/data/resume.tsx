    "Developer obsessed with how things work under the hood whether it's systems, networks, or AI. Just learning, Just shipping.",

  summary:
    "I'm Charuvarthan, a developer who never really fit into the easy lane. What hooked me wasn't just writing code it was the chase of making systems smarter, faster, and harder to break. Somewhere along the way, I found myself publishing research on LSTMs for battery systems, diving into CS fundamentals like they were boss fights, and grinding LeetCode like it's a sport. For me, tech isn't just about building apps it's about shaping ideas into systems that can stand tall in the real world. Whether it's system design, operating systems, or AI, I'm in it for the depth, the grind, and the fun of solving problems that actually matter.",
